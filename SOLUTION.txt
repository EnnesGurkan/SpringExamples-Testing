@Vaue is an anatation that we use extensively with Java spring boot. Although I tried different methods to write the test of the paramteric value we receive with @valu, this solution is the most convenient. You can apply the following solution for the value you use with @Value used in the class to be tested in the class to be tested that we have made Injeck Mock.

@Value("${greeting.salutation}")
private String greetingSalutation;  
ReflectionTestUtils.setField(writeConsole, "greetingSalutation", greetingSalutation);
